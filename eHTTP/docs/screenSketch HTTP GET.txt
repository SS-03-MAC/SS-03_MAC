# Purpose of File
# This file shows an example TCP conversation between a client (>) and
# eHTTP (<).  This example shows the HTTP 1.1 request (1) from the browser or
# app without TLS.  The server tracks the session using a cookie (4).  This
# request (1) is requesting information for a user with the ID of 5.  The body
# (3) of the response is a JSON object containing the user information available
# to the user of the current session.  The response headers (2) are simply
# standard HTTP response headers.
# The different API endpoints can be reached by changing the URL (5).  The
# returned data is filtered through the ACLs of the current user that has been
# authenticated previously.
